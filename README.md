**Welcome To NIDUS SPARC!**
This is a repository dedicated to my open source code developed at NIDUS.
NIDUS (Northern Institute for Deep Learning In Ultrasound) is based at the University of Alberta in Emdonton Alberta, Canada.

The contents of this repository contain mostly experimental Python scripts that I used to learn how to use different
libraries and methods. These files pertain to automated processes for dataset preparation for AI object detection models.
