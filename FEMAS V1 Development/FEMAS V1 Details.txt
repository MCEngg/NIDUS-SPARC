# Script Summary:
# This script creates a mask image and an overlayed image of rectangles and polygons on top of the original image. These images are then saved to the
# same DICOM folders where the original images could be found.
#
# Important Comments:
# This file should be kept in the same directory as the [ANNOTATOR-DATA][ANNOTATE-SCHEMA].json file, the Fetal Echo JSON file, and the 
# study folders that hold the DICOM folders.
# The JSON files are hardcoded into this file and require manual manipulation.
#
# To Run the File:
# There are 2 ways to run this script. Either through an IDE and by pressing the play button or by going through a terminal (LINUX UBUNTU was used to create this one).
#
# To run this script through LINUX:
# 1. Navigate to the directory where this script is located along with the JSON files (see above for more details)
# 2. Create a virtual environment for Python
# 	- python3 -m venv ~/FEMAS_v1.3-venv
# 3. Activate the virtual environment
# 	- source ~/FEMAS_v1.3-venv/bin/activate
# 4. Install any libraries that are required for the script (if not already installed)
# 	- pip install numpy
# 	- pip install opencv-python
# 5. Run the script
# 	- python3 ./FEMAS_v1.3.py



IMPORTANT: Due to privacy and sensitive data, there are no JPG images. This program does work as expected.
