#
# Script Summary:
# Using the hierarchy JSON path loop through all of the Study Instance UID's and look at each specific DICOM
# folder for the JPG frames. Then use the FEMAS_v1.3 masking and overlay function to create the masks and overlays.
# Before saving the masks and overlays, create a directory for each masks and overlays and store them in the respective
# directories.
# 
# The script will create a Overlay directory and a Mask directory in each of the DICOM folders and will store the respective images
# in each folder.
# 
# Important Comments:
# This file should be kept in the same directory as the annotation and Fetal-Echo hierarchy JSON files. It should also be 
# located next to the JPGMO folder for the selected study.
# 
# Worst Case Scenario: O(n^2)
